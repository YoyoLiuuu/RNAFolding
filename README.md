# RNA Folding

## Background
RNA molecules are crucial compoments in the central dogma of biology. Not only are they the intermediary messengers of all genetic information in a cell, but they have a whole host of functions ranging from regulating gene expression, to being the primary genetic material for viruses. Yet, our understanding of these vital molecules are limited by our current methods, namely the inability to model RNA. RNA when synthesized in the cell immediately folds up into a tertiary/three dimensional structure, creating a "landscape" of potential folding pathways and configurations. Studying these structures are crucial for understanding one of the most important molecules in an organism, enabling faster drug discovery processes, better vaccines, and more. Solving this problem would instantly revolutionize the world, making this an extremely pressing problem. To address this very problem, the RNA Folding team is developing a state-of-the-art model for RNA sequence to tertiary structure prediction.
